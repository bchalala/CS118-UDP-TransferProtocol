We shared a large part of the work. We feel that our contribution were pretty much equal.

Chul Hee Woo:
Worked on most of the UDP connection stuff, implemented packet creation, packet design, and
packet transmission over UDP.

Brett Chalabian:
Worked on the report, the design of the sliding window linked list, and timeouts.
